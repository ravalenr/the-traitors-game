# 🎭 THE TRAITORS: Online Multiplayer Game
## Project Pitch

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

An online multiplayer deception game inspired by *The Traitors* reality TV show. Players must work together during the day while secretly identifying traitors who eliminate them at night. Trust no one.

---

## 👥 How It Works

### **Game Setup**
- **5-12 players** per match
- **1-2 traitors** randomly assigned (depends on player count)
- All other players are **Faithfuls**
- Everyone starts with **0 XP points**

### **Day Phase (Challenge Time)**
- All players participate in **team challenges**
- Completing challenges earns **XP points** for the group pot
- Players discuss and **vote to banish** one suspected traitor
- If a Traitor is banished → XP stays in the pot
- If a Faithful is banished → Less people to share the prize

### **Night Phase (Murder Time)**
- Traitors secretly choose one **Faithful to eliminate**
- Murdered players are out of the game
- The group discovers who died at the start of next day

### **Victory Conditions**
- **Faithfuls Win:** Banish all Traitors before 3 players remain
    - Remaining Faithfuls split the XP pot equally
- **Traitors Win:** Survive until only 3 players remain with at least 1 Traitor
    - Traitors take ALL the XP points
