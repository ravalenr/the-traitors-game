# üéØ AGILE SCRUM FRAMEWORK
## The Traitors Game - 3-Person Team

---

## üìñ Scrum Basics (Simplified for 3 People)

### **What is Scrum?**
Agile framework that breaks work into short cycles (Sprints) with regular check-ins, demos, and improvements.

### **Key Roles (Adapted for 3-Person Team)**
- **Product Owner** - Decides WHAT to build and prioritizes features (rotate this role or share it)
- **Scrum Master** - Keeps team on track, removes blockers (rotate each sprint)
- **Developers** - Everyone! All 3 of you build the game

**For your team:** Rotate roles each sprint so everyone learns leadership and project management.

---

## üèÉ Sprint Structure

### **Sprint Duration: 2 Weeks**
Perfect balance for students - enough time to build features, not too long to lose momentum.

### **Sprint Timeline Example**
```
Week 1:
Monday    - Sprint Planning (1-2 hours)
Daily     - Daily Standup (15 min, same time each day)
Friday    - Mid-sprint check-in (30 min)

Week 2:
Monday    - Daily Standup
Wednesday - Daily Standup
Friday    - Sprint Review (1 hour)
Friday    - Sprint Retrospective (30 min)
          - Sprint Planning for next sprint (1 hour)
```

---

## üóìÔ∏è Scrum Ceremonies

### **1. Sprint Planning (Start of Each Sprint)**
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**When:** First day of sprint  
**Who:** All 3 team members

**Agenda:**
1. Review Product Backlog
2. Select User Stories for this sprint
3. Break stories into tasks
4. Assign tasks to people
5. Set Sprint Goal

**Example Sprint Goal:** "Complete basic lobby system and player authentication"

**Output:**
- Sprint Backlog (selected user stories + tasks)
- Everyone knows what they're building
- Task assignments clear

---

### **2. Daily Standup**
**Duration:** 15 minutes MAX  
**When:** Same time every day (e.g., 10am or 7pm on Discord)  
**Who:** All 3 team members

**Each person answers 3 questions:**
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Any blockers/issues?

**Rules:**
- Keep it short and focused
- Don't solve problems here - flag them and solve later
- Use async standup if schedules don't align (post in Discord/Slack)

**Example:**
> **Person 1:** Yesterday I finished login API. Today I'm working on JWT tokens. No blockers.
>
> **Person 2:** Finished game state types. Today starting phase transitions. Need help understanding WebSocket events.
>
> **Person 3:** Chat UI is done. Today adding voice chat library. No blockers.

---

### **3. Sprint Review (End of Sprint)**
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**When:** Last day of sprint  
**Who:** All 3 team members (+ friends to demo to!)

**Agenda:**
1. Demo what you built (working features only!)
2. Each person shows their work
3. Test it together
4. Discuss what worked / what didn't
5. Get feedback from testers if available

**Goal:** Show off progress and celebrate wins! üéâ

---

### **4. Sprint Retrospective (After Review)**
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**When:** Right after Sprint Review  
**Who:** All 3 team members

**Three questions:**
1. What went well?
2. What didn't go well?
3. What will we improve next sprint?

**Example:**
```
WENT WELL:
- Good communication in Discord
- Hit our sprint goal!
- Code reviews helped catch bugs

DIDN'T GO WELL:
- Merge conflicts were messy
- Underestimated task complexity
- Missed 2 standups

IMPROVE NEXT SPRINT:
- Better git branch strategy
- Break tasks into smaller pieces
- Set standup reminder bot
```

## üí° Scrum Tips for Student Teams

### **1. Keep Ceremonies Short**
Don't spend 2 hours in daily standup. 15 min MAX.

### **2. Use Async When Needed**
Can't all meet? Post standup updates in Discord:
```
üìÖ Daily Standup - Oct 30
üü¢ @Person1: ‚úÖ Login API done | üöß Working on JWT | ‚ùå No blockers
üü¢ @Person2: ‚úÖ Game state types | üöß Phase transitions | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need WebSocket help
üü¢ @Person3: ‚úÖ Chat UI | üöß Voice chat | ‚ùå No blockers
```

### **3. Demo Early, Demo Often**
Show features as soon as they work, even if ugly. Catching issues early = less rework.

### **4. Celebrate Wins**
Finished a sprint goal? Order pizza. Shipped authentication? High fives all around.

### **5. Don't Over-Engineer**
Start simple. Get it working. Then make it pretty.

### **6. It's Okay to Fail Tasks**
Didn't finish everything? That's FINE. Move incomplete stories to next sprint. Adjust estimates.

### **7. Rotate Roles**
Everyone should experience being Scrum Master. Builds leadership skills.

## üéÆ You've Got This!

Scrum seems like a lot at first, but you'll get the rhythm quickly. The key benefits:

‚úÖ Everyone knows what they're working on
‚úÖ Regular check-ins catch problems early
‚úÖ Demos keep motivation high
‚úÖ You'll actually finish the project!

**Remember:** Scrum is flexible. Adapt it to what works for your team. The goal is to help you build The Traitors game, not to follow rules perfectly.

**First action:** Create your Trello board and schedule your Sprint 0 planning meeting! üöÄ

Good luck, team! May the Faithfuls win... or maybe the Traitors? üé≠
